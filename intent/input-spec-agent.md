**📝 Business Intent Title:** Real-Time Currency Conversion & Audit Trail

**💡 Business Idea:** Treasury operations teams at our enterprise customers
currently convert currency using manual lookups against a third-party
portal — slow, and it leaves no record for compliance. We need instant,
self-serve conversion inside our own app, and because these are regulated
transactions, every conversion must be reconstructable for an auditor on
demand, not pieced together afterward from emails or spreadsheets.

**👤 Persona:** Treasury operations analysts at enterprise customers, who
process multiple cross-border settlements a day and are personally
accountable if a conversion can't be justified during an audit.

**💚 User Need:** See a trustworthy converted amount the moment I enter it
— and be able to pull up any past conversion, with its rate and timestamp,
the moment an auditor asks for it.

Notice what's *not* here: no mention of caching, no mention of circuit
breakers, no mention of `IHttpClientFactory`. Those come from the Spec
Agent's technical elaboration, not from this layer.

**🔒 Known Constraints** *(fixed — carry through unchanged, do not reinterpret)*

- Frontend must read `VITE_API_URL` dynamically at container runtime using
  a generic entrypoint script placeholder replacement; replace the placeholder token
  `__VITE_API_URL__` inside the built `index.html` (or equivalent) with the runtime
  `VITE_API_URL` value.
- Backend must read database configurations exclusively from runtime
  environment variables.
- CI/CD pipeline must inject placeholders safely at deployment time without
  exposing sensitive data in container layers.
- Restricted to specific stack versions: React (Vite/Node 24.*) and C#
  (**backend must target `net10.0` for build/test; CI must use `dotnet-version: 10.0.x`**).
- Must adhere to a strict folder layout (`src/frontend` and `src/backend`).
- Deploy as a single Azure Container App using the sidecar pattern to host
  both frontend and backend.
- Authenticate to Cosmos DB exclusively using token-based authentication via the pre-assigned User-Assigned Managed Identity, instantiated using `DefaultAzureCredential` configured with the specific `ManagedIdentityClientId`. Absolutely zero connection strings, master keys, or account keys are permitted in code, configurations, or logs.
- Utilize `Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos` and `Azure.Identity` packages for
  secure, token-based database interactions, including data-plane CRUD operations like adding and deleting items.
- Include `Azure.ResourceManager` and `Azure.ResourceManager.CosmosDB` packages to programmatically provision the Cosmos DB database and container via the control plane inside the application startup lifecycle (`Program.cs`) before the web application runs, utilizing the same token-based Managed Identity credentials for authentication.
  - ARM provisioning is best-effort; Managed Identity RBAC for ARM may differ from data-plane RBAC.
  - CRUD (and data-plane creation if needed) must be done via the Cosmos SDK (data-plane) using token-based Managed Identity credentials; access keys must not be used.
  - After ARM attempt, startup must run token-authenticated data-plane `CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync` and `CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync` and only proceed if the database/container are available (either already exist or were created). If token-authenticated data-plane create-if-not-exists fails, startup must fail.
- Map and bind all configuration values, including `AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, endpoint URLs, and resource names, directly from the environment variables **using the exact keys** defined in `docs\CONTAINER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` without using local settings configuration files as fallbacks.
